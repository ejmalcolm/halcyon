- need two task views: one for the ActionDock tasks that are not active yet, and one for the actual tasks

-make sure tasks aren't being duplicated when they're called by ui.cause_action, i think they might be

-make sure octant.class_objects_in() checks actually update everytime load_gamestate is called so that there aren't phantom action parameters

-on each player object, have a list of the tags they have available, etc.
    -generally the idea that stuff is unlocked by research
    -tech tree esque
    -stored under the player object

-put use_function as a client method for all objects
    - the arguments are all function tags of the object

STARTED WORK ON:

- engineer create_building_plan
    -just need to add the tags from the player storage
