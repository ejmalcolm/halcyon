- a way of making sure that only the right players can view certain octants
    - i.e. you should only be able to see octant contents if you have a unit in that octant

- need two task views: one for the ActionDock tasks that are not active yet, and one for the actual tasks

-make sure tasks aren't being duplicated when they're called by ui.cause_action, i think they might be

-make sure tasks are actually happening and causing gamestate changes
