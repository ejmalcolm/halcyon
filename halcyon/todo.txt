- a way of making sure that only the right players can view certain octants
    - i.e. you should only be able to see octant contents if you have a unit in that octant

- need two task views: one for the ActionDock tasks that are not active yet, and one for the actual tasks

-make sure tasks aren't being duplicated when they're called by ui.cause_action, i think they might be

-make sure tasks are actually happening and causing gamestate changes

-make sure octant.class_objects_in() checks actually update everytime load_gamestate is called so that there aren't phantom action parameters


STARTED WORK ON:

- engineer create_building_plan, going to be very interesting because it needs a large amount of arguments that can be multiple selected
    - honestly its probably best to just special-case it
    - send it in a special tuple, detect what it is in halcyon_client, then create a dialog just for making a building plan
